Necessary additions:
	- Robot loaders
	- Experiment loaders
	- OpenRAVE wrapper

Necessary tests:
	- Midlevel test:
		- Builder
		- Object Resolver Factory
	- Manipulation test
	- Robot load test
	- Experiment load test

Nice to haves:
	- serialization
	- config to library
	- common robot specification
	- Non primitive objects
	- update whole objects
	- direct creation of relative positions
	- edit virtual objects as opposed to updating them (?)
	- create object by just prefab name + position
	- unify outward interface
